# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: MAR 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Took a look at my wordpress blog's code trying to fix an immage issue. 

**Thoughts:** took a look at Machine Learning Crash Course from google and noticed I was very far out of my comfort zone. I have lived in the embeded programing world during school and have not programed outside of it in some time. I have programed in Java, Matlab and C++. I feel it has been so long that I have no idea what I am doing.
